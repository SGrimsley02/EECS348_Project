The completed Boolean Logic Simulator can be accessed by downloading BooleanLogicSimulator.exe and running it. This will open a commandline interface with a message explaining the intended use.

Enter expressions using T/F for True/False, and &, |, !, @, and $ for the various logical operators as defined in the opening message. Type Exit to exit the program (several variations of this command are also accepted).

The code for the simulator can be found in the various files in this folder, with the file names and contained comments explaining what each element is in charge of.
