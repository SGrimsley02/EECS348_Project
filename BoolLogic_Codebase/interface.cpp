#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

/*
This program will handle any and all interaction with the user. It should be able to ask the user for input
before passing off to the input parser, then it should send the output of the evaluator back to the user
in a readable format.
This should also have a way of handling any errors that may arise, giving the user a message saying what went
wrong without breaking the program.
Lastly, this should have a way to end the program.
All of this should be done with a readable interface. While it does not need to be overly complicated,
any method that will allow the user to easily understand what is going on and what they can do is acceptable.
This may mean a commandline interface, or it could also be a graphical interface of some kind. The primary concern
is readability and functionality.
