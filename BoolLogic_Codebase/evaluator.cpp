/*
This is where the actual evaluation occurs. It should be able to take an input from exp parser,
then give a boolean output corresponding to the original equation.
    Note: While variable inputs can and should be in the final product, they will take a somewhat
    different approach to implement since the final output will likely not be just True or False.
    As such, start with the simpler case, figure out what's needed for that, then build from there.
The output of this should be able to be passed back to the interface to be shown to the user.
