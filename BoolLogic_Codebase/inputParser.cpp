/* 
This file should define an input parser. It should take an input string from the interface, then turn it into something usable by the evaluator.
  This may or may not be a string, it will depend on implementation of expression parser.
  If there are characters not necessary for the expression parser, then these characters should be removed
  by the input parser. Ex: spaces
Throw errors if input is bad, these will be caught by the interface.
Return the output of the evaluator, or return the string to the interface to then be sent to the evaluator
