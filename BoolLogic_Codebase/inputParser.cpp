/* 
This file should define an input parser. It should be able to scan for inputs, then
take it in as a string. After that, it should transform it into a usable form for the expression parser.
  This may or may not be a string, it will depend on implementation of expression parser.
  If there are characters not necessary for the expression parser, then these characters should be removed
  by the input parser.
