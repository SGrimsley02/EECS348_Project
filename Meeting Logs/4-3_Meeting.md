# Meeting Log
**Date:** Apr 3, 5:00pm

**Purpose:** Software Architecture Overview and Code Commencement

**Attendance:** Sam, Blair, Justin, Jason, Conner 

## Outline
* Discuss Software Architecture Document
* Assign roles for document completion
* Discuss code outlining and planning

## Summary
We took a brief look at the Software Architecture Document that was provided to us through Canvas, noting how each section will be organized. After that, we divided up the work in a similar fashion to the previous documents:

- Team Administrators will work primarily on the Introduction
- Team Leaders will work mostly on the higher-level descriptions (Sections 2 and 3)
- Quality Assurance and Technical Leads will focus on the more specific elements (Sections 5, 6, 8)

Additionally, we laid out the plan to start implementing some actual code and building up our program. To start with this will focus on lots of pseudocode, which will then be filled out as anyone in the group has ideas for specific functions. This will become more focused as we continue on, and programming will be more structured; for now, it was deemed more important to start building out the base, rather than building specific parts up.

A few example elements of the program that should start to receive attention are an input handler, input parser/converter, expression parser/validator, logical functions, and an output handler, although these are not all elements required and any of these may be further broken down or combined.

## Important Dates
