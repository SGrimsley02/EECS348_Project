## Outline
* Look over SRS Document
* Assign work to each role
* Make sure everything is in a good spot going into the break

## Summary
This ended up as a very brief meeting simply to look over the document and give some loose ideas of who will be covering what sections. Quality Assurance and Technical Leader will be connected to the more technical aspects of the document such as requirements and functionality, Team Administration will focus more on the introduction sections and aiding in table creation/data recording, and Team Leaders will focus on the higher-level description of the product. 

As we will all be leaving shortly for spring break, we ended with the expectation that little will be done over the next week, so we will reconvene after the break to flesh out specifics of the project, as well as talk about any other work that will be commencing soon. With that being said, we wrapped up any loose ends from the Project Plan and other aspects that needed addressing and ended the meeting early.

## Important Dates
