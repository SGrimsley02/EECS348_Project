# Meeting Log
**Date:** Feb 14, 5:00pm
**Purpose:** Welcome meeting
**Attendance:** Sam Grimsley, Blair Bassett, Conner Glazner, Abhiroop Goel, Jason Do, Justin Owolabi

## Summary
Today we met over Zoom as a group for the first time. This meeting was mostly concerned with just putting names to faces,
as we do not have the project description yet. Once that is released we will be organizing our next meeting in
order to start filling out the Project Management Plan.

During the meeting, we established the Github Repository and shared it with all the group members. We then
discussed plans for how to manage editing the Project Management Plan and future documents, settling on using Google
Drive to share and edit the docs while maintaining up-to-date copies on Github, that way everyone can easily view and
edit the documents. Meeting notes will remain .txt files saved on Github for ease of access.

Lastly, we attempted to come up with a team/company name, with the top choice at the moment being "Miracle Workers". 
This name is likely to change.

## Next Meeting
**TBD**, will be decided once project description is posted and/or closer to the first deadline. Most likely in-person.
