# Meeting Log
**Date:** Feb 14, 3:45pm

**Purpose:** Project Overview and Planning

**Attendance:** Sam, Blair, Jason, Justin, Conner

## Outline
* Decide on team name
* Assign and define project roles
* Determine any project standards
* Create plan for completion of Project Plan

## Summary
Before the meeting, it was noted in class that advanced options such as allowing variables and generating truth tables may be worth extra credit.

We quickly decided on the team/company name "Boolean Logic Legends" before moving on to discussing roles and the document plan.
The current roles can be found on the Project Plan document and below:
* Project Lead: Sam Grimsley
* Assistant Project Lead: Blair Bassett
* Team Administrator: Jason Do
* Assistant Team Administrator: Roop Goel
* Technical Leader: Conner Glazner
* Quality Assurance Engineer: Justin Owolabi

As Roop was not in attendance, we gave him the role of Assistant Team Administrator because it is not as of yet well defined, allowing him to contribute in whatever way he sees fit without unnecessary restrictions.

After that we began work on the document plan, assigning sections to be completed by each person. The project leads are responsible for the management sections, team administrators are responsible for project organization, the technical leader is in charge of the project overview, and the introduction is being taken care of by the quality engineer, with everyone helping out with other sections as needed. Work was divided in this way to more closely reflect the responsibilities of each position, allowing us to get a better understanding of our specific work as we continue to define our roles.

We ended the meeting making sure everyone has what they need in order to complete their parts, with the understanding that everyone is reachable in the group chat if anything comes up. Our next meeting will likely take place next week, so long as there are no issues completing the project plan.

## Important Dates
* February 24- Complete Project Plan
* February 25- Project Management Plan Due

The next meeting has been rescheduled for March 6 at 4:30, via Zoom.
